<h3>Know how to code?</h3>
<p>The entire project consists of Java, Python and a Javascript web client. If you're familiar with any of those programming languages, it'll be a great practice! We’re grateful for any contributions you might want to make. For designing the application, we're currently using JavaFX. For the Python however, we'll be using this for the machine learning and AI, keyboard + mouse inputs for the automation.<br>

For adding documentation, it’ll be awesomely helpful! All of these documents are written via DocFX. <br>
</p>
<h3>Without coding?</h3>
<p>Wanted to do the easiest contribution? Do our testing. Simply use the application and run into problems and let us know. This is the normal way to uncover bugs.</p>
