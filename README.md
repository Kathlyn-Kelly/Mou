<h3>Know how to code?</h3>
<p>The entire project consists of Java and Python. If you're familiar with any of those programming languages, it'll be a great practice! We’re grateful for any contributions you might want to make. For designing the application, we're currently using JavaFX. For the Python however, I'll be using this for the machine learning and AI, keyboard + mouse inputs for the automation.<br>
  
For adding documentation, it’ll be awesomely helpful! All of these documents are written via DocFX. <br>
